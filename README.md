# NintendoSpy wxViewer
I created this tiny application to display the controller data, captured using NintendoSpy, on my Macbook.

It is NOT as feature packed as the official Windows application, and I have NOT put any effort into user friendlyness. You will probably have to edit the source code to get it working on your system, and it depends on several libraries your Perl distribution probably didn't come with.
